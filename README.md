# Book Store API
# API Development with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

In this project, I built a RESTful API using Node.js and the Express.js framework, with MongoDB for data storage. The API provides essential CRUD operations, and I implemented several key concepts and techniques to ensure security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Key Features and Technologies

- **HTTP Methods**: Implemented essential HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for handling requests.
- **Postman Client**: Used Postman to test and document the API endpoints.
- **Input Validation**: Ensured data integrity and security by validating input data before processing.
- **Authentication & Authorization with JWT**: Implemented secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Password Hashing**: Used bcrypt.js for securely hashing user passwords.
- **Mongoose ODM**: Utilized Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to interact with MongoDB.
- **Middleware in Express.js**: Leveraged Express middleware for error handling, logging, and request processing.
